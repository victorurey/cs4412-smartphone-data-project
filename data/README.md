# Pattern Discovery in Smartphone Pricing and Hardware Specifications
This project explores pricing, hardware specification, brand strategy, and consumer buying trends to paint a broader picture of the smartphone market over the last thirty years. Two data sets are used to: (1) discover how specific hardware features relate to price tiers across leading brands, and (2) which hardware components appear among the most popular phones and how do companies iterate on them in the future. Patterns are found using a combination of clustering and association rules to reveal specification hardware combinations that have catapulted a few brands to international success in the smartphone market.
